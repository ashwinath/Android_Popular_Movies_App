# Popular Movies
An android app that I did while learning programming in my free time.

Idea was inspired from Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree programme.

## Features
* Check out most popular and highest rated movies
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## How to compile
* Add your own API key from [The Movie Database](http://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/API) to strings.xml.
